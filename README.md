Final project for n315

Live Link: https://n315-cb-final.web.app/

For this project, we were to recreate the Keurig website. In this recreation, the only pages that work are the cart page and the coffee makers page. If not signed in, a user will not be able to add one of the coffee makers to their cart. After signing in, you can add one to your cart and the cart icon in the top right will show how many items are in the cart. Upon going to the cart page, it will show all the coffee makers you added, the total number of items, and the total price of the coffee makers. You can click the x on one of the items to just remove the one from the cart or you can clear the entire cart with the button at the top. Information about the cart is saved locally and will not stay upon refresh.
